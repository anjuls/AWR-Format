<h1>AWR Formatter</h1>

<p></p>

<h2>Primary Features</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Convert hard to read sizes such as "reads" and "gets" to KB / MB / GB /
    TB.</li>
  <li>Convert hard to read times such as thousands of seconds to hours /
    minutes / seconds.</li>
  <li>Link common wait events to their definitions. A local copy of the
    definitions is included so internet access is not necessary.</li>
  <li>Large HTML tables of data are sortable and searchable. </li>
  <li>Top SQL by <em>Elapsed</em>, <em>Reads</em>, <em>Gets</em>, and
    <em>Executions</em> are combined into one table. </li>
  <li>A SQL Popup that is called when you click on any SQL in the report. This
    shows the SQL with several formatting options, including the option for
    syntax highlighting to make it easier to read. New tabs were added in
    version 1.6:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Query Plan</strong>: Shows the statement to execute to query
        the AWR repository and return the plan for this SQL statement.</li>
      <li><strong>Color SQL:</strong> This shows the statement to execute to
        "color" a SQL statement. Once a statement is colored, it will always
        show up in the AWR report, regardless of whether it's in the top n SQL
        or not.</li>
      <li><strong>AWR SQL Report</strong>: Shows the statement to execute to
        generate an AWR report for a single query. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A tabbed interface is added to the top to surface key information. The
    tabs include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Overview</strong>: A concise list of key attributes and
      values</li>
      <li><strong>Top SQL Combined</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Top Events</strong>: Data from the Top Events sections, such
        as Top 5 Timed Foreground Events, are shown together in one tab.
        Metrics below a certain threshold, such as less than 2% of DB Time, are
        filtered.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Observations</strong>: Certain metrics and values are worth
        additional investigation. These could include the use of undocumented
        parameters or an AWR Report that spans a period of time greater than 60
        minutes. The observations are listed here and are also emphasized on
        the report with a red icon.</li>
      <li><strong>IO Graphs</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each HTML table offers "CSV Export"</li>
</ol>
